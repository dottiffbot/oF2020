### questions!
1. how to "tie" vectors so stuff moves together.
2. how should I switch from scene to scene? (should I make a counter?) Can I do this when key is pressed?
3. should I separate the different scenes into functions?
4. How do I rotate stuff again?
5. How to draw outlines? How to set color to none (so bg image shows... do I just make it transparent?)
